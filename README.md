Food Ordering Application

Description

This project is a food ordering application implemented in C++ by our team Akatsuki. The app allows users to browse a menu, place orders, and manage their cart. The goal is to simulate a simple food ordering system with functionalities like adding items to the cart, viewing the cart, removing items, and checking out.

Features

Browse Menu: View a list of available food items.
Add to Cart: Add food items to your cart.
View Cart: View items in your cart along with the total price.
Remove from Cart: Remove items from your cart.
Checkout: Finalize your order and receive a summary of your purchase.

Requirements

C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)
Standard Template Library (STL)

Usage

Launch the application.
Browse the menu and view the list of available food items.
Add items to your cart by selecting the item number.
View your cart to see the items you have added.
Remove items if needed by specifying the item number.
Checkout to finalize your order and see the total amount.
